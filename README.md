# Queue-System-and-Evaluation

  This project relates to a queue system. It aims to evaluate client satisfaction and to help to manage the time of queue waiting and to provide useful notifications when an individualâ€™s place in the queue is nearing the end. This project has two sections: they are 1) Queue management; and 2) Evaluation system. This involves a queue card system, a booking with notification system, and an evaluated results and statistics system. As for system usability, users can book through the queue card system and book with the notification system. However, officers can manage the queue by the system of queue management. As for the evaluated results and statistics system, officers can view their scores evaluated and statistics. The system has been tested under the use of several applications. The result was that all systems can work together without any problems on the machine. The system is supported on Android versions at least 4.0, and web applications on Google Chrome and Firefox.
